}
\arguments{
\item{mbSetObj}{Input the name of the mbSetObj.}

\item{taxrank}{Character, input the taxonomic level
to perform partial correlation analysis.}

\item{cor.method}{Character, input the correlation method.
Supported methods are pearson, spearman, kendall and sparcc.}

\item{colorOpt}{Character, input what to color the nodes by. Default
the nodes will be colored by their expression levels.}

\item{permNum}{Numeric, input the number of permutations to perform. Default
is set to 100.}

\item{pvalCutoff}{Numeric, input the p-value cutoff. Default is set to 0.05.}

\item{corrCutoff}{Numeric, input the correlation cutoff. Default is set to 0.3.}

\item{abundOpt}{Character, default is set to "mean".}

\item{corr.net.name}{Character, input the name of the plot to save.}

\item{plotNet}{Boolean. Set to TRUE if you would like a network visualization
outputted to your current working directory.}

\item{netLayout}{Character, layout from ggraph. "kk" for the spring-based algorithm by Kamada and Kawai
as default. "drl" for force directed algorithm from the DrL toolbox. "lgl" for Large Graph Layout. "fr" for
force-directed of Fruchterman and Reingold.}

\item{netTextSize}{Numeric, input the preferred font size to be used in the network
plot.}

\item{networkType}{Character, "static" to create a static image or
"interactive" to create an interactive network saved as an html
in your working directory.}
}

This function runs the fastspar or cor.test
