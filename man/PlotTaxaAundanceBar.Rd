\title{Function to plot bar charts for alpha diversity}
\usage{
PlotTaxaAundanceBar(
  mbSetObj,
  barplotName,
  taxalvl,
  facet,
  facet2,
  imgOpt,
  feat_cnt,
  colpalopt,
  calcmeth,
  toptaxa,
  abunTopTaxaOpt,
  appendnm,
  format = "png",
  dpi = 72,
  interactive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mbSetObj}{Input the name of the mbSetObj.}

\item{barplotName}{Character, input the name of the barplot.}

\item{taxalvl}{Character, input the taxonomic level to perform
classification. For instance, "Genus" to use the Genus level.}

\item{facet}{Character, set the group to separate the bar plots.}

\item{imgOpt}{Character, set the graph type. Stacked bar
using the actual abundance, use "barraw". Stacked bar using
the percentage abundance, use "barnorm".}

\item{feat_cnt}{Set the minimum feature count that is used to "bin"
together small taxa.}

\item{colpalopt}{Select the color palette options. "set3",
which is the Set3 from the R Color Brewer, "cont21" which is
a set of 21 colors, "cont28" which is a set of 28 colors, and
"cont42" which is a set of 42 colors. For users who wish to use
a color palette robust to colorblindness
/(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html/),
use "viridis", "magma", "plasma", or "inferno".}

\item{calcmeth}{Merge small taxa based on the sum /("sum"/)
or median /("med"/) counts across all samples or groups.}

\item{format}{Character, input the preferred
format of the plot. By default it is set to "png".}

\item{dpi}{Numeric, input the dots per inch. By default
it is set to 72.}

\item{interactive}{Boolean, if TRUE, will save an interactive
version of the Stacked Bar plot using plotly.}

\item{metadata}{If users wish to merge samples to groups in the stacked bar plot,
set this to the preferred grouping.}
