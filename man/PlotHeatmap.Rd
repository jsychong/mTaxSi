}
\arguments{
\item{mbSetObj}{Input the name of the mbSetObj.}

\item{plotNm}{Character, input the name
of the plot.}

\item{smplDist}{Input the distance measure. "euclidean" for
Euclidean distance, "correlation" for Pearson, and "minkowski"
for Minkowski.}

\item{clstDist}{Character, input the name of the
selected clustering algorithm. "ward" for Ward, "average" for Average,
"complete" for Complete, and "single" for Single.}

\item{palette}{Set the colors of the heatmap. By default it
is set to "bwm", blue, white, to red. Use "gbr" for green, black, red, use
"heat" for red to yellow, "topo" for blue to yellow, "gray" for
white to black, and "byr" for blue, yellow, red.}

\item{metadata}{Character, input the name of the experimental factor
to cluster samples by.}

\item{taxrank}{Character, input the taxonomic level to perform
classification. For instance, "OTU-level" to use OTUs.}

\item{viewOpt}{Character, "overview" to view an overview
of the heatmap, and "detail" to iew a detailed view of the
heatmap (< 1500 features).}

\item{doclust}{Logicial, default set to "F".}

\item{format}{Character, input the preferred
format of the plot. By default it is set to "png".}

\item{showfeatname}{Logical, "T" to show feature names and
"F" to not.}

\item{appendnm}{Logical, "T" to prepend higher taxon names.}

\item{rowV}{Logical, default set to "F".}

\item{colV}{Logical, default set to "T".}

\item{var.inx}{Default set to NA.}

\item{width}{Numeric, input the width of the plot. By
default it is set to NA.}

\item{dpi}{Numeric, input the dots per inch. By default
it is set to 72.}
