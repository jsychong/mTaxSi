\title{Function to perform categorical comparison.}
\usage{
PerformCategoryComp(
  mbSetObj,
  taxaLvl,
  method,
  distnm,
  variable,
  covariates = FALSE,
  cov.vec = NA,
  model.additive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mbSetObj}{Input the name of the mbSetObj.}

\item{taxaLvl}{Input the name of the taxonomic level to calculate Beta-diversity comparison.}

\item{method}{Statistical method to calculate
beta-diversity significance. Use "adonis" for Permutational MANOVA, "anosim" for
Analysis of Group Similarities and "permdisp" for
Homogeneity of Group Dispersions.}

\item{distnm}{Character, input the name of the distance method. "bray" for
Bray-Curtis Index, "jsd" for Jensen-Shannon Divergence, "jaccard" for Jaccard Index,
"unifrac" for Unweighted Unifrac Distance and "wunifrac" for Weighted Unifrac Distance.}

\item{variable}{Input the name of the experimental factor to group the samples.}

\item{covariates}{Boolean. TRUE to consider covariates, FALSE to only consider the
main effect. Only valid for PERMANOVA.}

\item{cov.vec}{Character vector. Input the names of the covariates to consider in the
PERMANOVA model.}

\item{model.additive}{Boolean. If TRUE, the model will be additive (i.e. data ~ var1 + var2),
making the assumption that the two factor variables are independent.
However, if FALSE, the model will consider the synergistic effects of the variables - interaction (i.e. data ~ var1*var2).
"Different explanatory variables the effects on the outcome of a change in one variable may either not depend on the
level of the other variable (additive model) or it may depend on the level of the other variable (interaction model)."}
