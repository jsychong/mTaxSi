\title{Main function to plot pie graphs of microbiome data.}
\usage{
PlotOverallPieGraph(
  mbSetObj,
  taxalvl,
  feat_cnt,
  calcmeth,
  toptaxapie,
  pietoptaxaopt
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mbSetObj}{Input the name of the mbSetObj.}

\item{taxalvl}{Character, input the taxonomic level to perform
classification. For instance, "Genus" to use the Genus level.}

\item{feat_cnt}{Set the minimum feature count that is used to "bin"
together small taxa.}

\item{calcmeth}{Merge small taxa based on the sum /("sum"/)
or median /("med"/) counts across all samples or groups.}
}
\description{
This functions plots pie graphs of microbiome data.
In particular, it plots the overall pie chart (all samples). The
data used to calculate the pie-chart is saved in your working
