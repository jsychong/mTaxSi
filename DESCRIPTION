Description: mTaxSi is an R package for exploratory metabolic analysis of   
            taxonomic microbial signatures. It leverages genome-scale metabolic models 
            to empower researchers to predict metabolic differences between disease phenotypes based 
            on their taxonomic composition and prioritize these for future metabolomics experiments.
